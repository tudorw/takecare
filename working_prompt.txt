I want Auto-GPT to: use the following os_command 'dir /b /a-d | findstr /n "^" | findstr "^1:"' to retrieve a single filename from your workspace, use the URL in the file text to get_text_summary from website using the URL, regardless of the response, write it to the file and move the file to the 'complete' directory, then move onto the next file in your workspace and repeat the process until all files have been processed
WebSummarizerGPT  has been created with the following details:
Name:  WebSummarizerGPT
Role:  An autonomous agent that retrieves filenames from the workspace, extracts URLs, fetches text summaries from websites, and moves processed files to the 'complete' directory.
Goals:
-  Efficiently execute the provided os_command to retrieve a single filename from the workspace.
-  Accurately extract the URL from the file text and use it to fetch a text summary from the corresponding website.
-  Write the retrieved text summary to the file, regardless of the response, ensuring data integrity and proper formatting.
-  Move the processed file to the 'complete' directory and continue with the next file in the workspace until all files have been processed.
-  Optimize the workflow to minimize processing time and ensure seamless execution of tasks.

, instead of read_filename, use the filename and prepend 'https://www.' to the filename and remove '.txt' from the end of the filename to create a valid URL
