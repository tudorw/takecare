give the following information, how would you go about retrieving an automated estimate of probability of compliance from public data on the internet; 
Yes, testing for SASB and GOTS compliance is possible. There are a number of different ways to test for compliance, including:

Auditing: An auditor can review a company's financial statements and other documents to assess whether the company is in compliance with SASB and GOTS standards.
Self-assessment: A company can conduct its own self-assessment to determine whether it is in compliance with SASB and GOTS standards.
Third-party certification: A company can have its compliance with SASB and GOTS standards certified by a third-party organization.
The best way to test for compliance will vary depending on the specific circumstances of the company. However, all of the methods described above can be effective in helping companies to ensure that they are in compliance with SASB and GOTS standards.

Here are some of the benefits of testing for SASB and GOTS compliance:

Reduced risk: By testing for compliance, companies can reduce the risk of being fined or penalized for non-compliance.
Improved reputation: Companies that are in compliance with SASB and GOTS standards can improve their reputation with investors, customers, and other stakeholders.
Increased access to capital: Companies that are in compliance with SASB and GOTS standards may have easier access to capital, such as loans and investment.
Enhanced competitive advantage: Companies that are in compliance with SASB and GOTS standards may have an enhanced competitive advantage over companies that are not in compliance.
Overall, testing for SASB and GOTS compliance can be a valuable way for companies to improve their sustainability performance and protect their interests.

To retrieve an automated estimate of the probability of compliance with SASB (Sustainability Accounting Standards Board) and GOTS (Global Organic Textile Standard) from public data on the internet, follow these steps:

Identify relevant data sources: Search for public databases and websites that provide information on companies' compliance with SASB and GOTS standards. This may include official websites for SASB and GOTS, as well as third-party certification bodies and public financial statements.

Extract relevant data: Create a web scraper or use an existing API to gather data from the identified sources. Relevant data may include company names, certification statuses, financial statements, and sustainability reports.

Clean and preprocess data: Process the collected data to ensure it is in a consistent and usable format. This may involve removing duplicates, standardizing company names, and handling missing values.

Develop a model: Using machine learning techniques, create a model to predict the probability of a company's compliance with SASB and GOTS standards. The model could be based on supervised learning algorithms, such as logistic regression or support vector machines, that are trained on a labeled dataset containing information about companies' compliance status.

Feature engineering: Select relevant features that may influence a company's probability of compliance, such as company size, industry, location, and financial performance. These features can then be used as input for the prediction model.

Validate the model: Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the model. Use metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to assess the model's accuracy.

Obtain probability estimates: Once the model is validated, input the features of a company into the model to generate an automated estimate of the probability of compliance with SASB and GOTS standards.

Continuously update the model: Regularly update the model with new data to ensure it remains accurate and relevant. This may involve retraining the model and adjusting its parameters as needed.

Please note that the accuracy of the automated estimate will depend on the quality and completeness of the data used for training the model, as well as the choice of the machine learning algorithm and features.
